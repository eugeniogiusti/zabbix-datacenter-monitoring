# Zabbix 6.4 Installation and Configuration on Ubuntu 22.04

This repository contains a Bash script for automating the installation and configuration of Zabbix 6.4 on an Ubuntu 22.04 server using the LAMP stack.

---

### Test Environment - Monitored Devices
- 90 VMs (Linux and Windows).
- 4 hyper-converged cluster virtualizers.
- 2 layer switches.
- 2 firewalls in HA.
- 1 enterprise NAS for secure VM backups.

### Recommended Hardware Requirements for Virtual machine
- 150GB SSD.
- 8GB RAM.
- 4 vCPUs.

---

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Zabbix Server Optimization
In the configuration file `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf`, the `ValueCacheSize` value was adjusted to **64MB**.  

Benefits:
- Provides better stability for environments with a high number of monitored metrics (90+ VMs).
- Enhances performance for caching metrics.

---

### 2. MySQL Optimization
In the configuration file `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`, the following changes were made:  
1. **Uncommented and configured**:  
   ```ini
   log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
   binlog_expire_logs_seconds = 432000
   max_binlog_size   = 100M
   
Benefits:
- Reduces disk space used by binary logs while maintaining an adequate recovery window
- Efficient File Management: Smaller, more manageable log files improve read/write speed.
- binlog_expire_logs_seconds = 432000 (from 2592000, equivalent to 30 days, to 432000, equivalent to 5 days).

## Notes

- This script is intended for fresh Ubuntu 22.04 installations.
