Bash script for deploying Zabbix 6.4 on Ubuntu 22.04 with optimized settings for datacenter environments.

# Zabbix 6.4 Installation and Configuration on Ubuntu 22.04

This repository contains a Bash script for automating the installation and configuration of Zabbix 6.4 on an Ubuntu 22.04 server using the LAMP stack.

---

### Test Environment - Monitored Devices
- 90 VMs (Linux and Windows).
- 4 hyper-converged cluster virtualizers.
- 2 layer switches.
- 2 firewalls in HA.
- 1 enterprise NAS for secure VM backups.

### Recommended Hardware Requirements for Virtual machine
- 150GB SSD.
- 8GB RAM.
- 4 vCPUs.

---

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Zabbix Server Optimization
In the configuration file `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf`, the `ValueCacheSize` value was adjusted to **64MB**.  

Benefits:
- Provides better stability for environments with a high number of monitored metrics (90+ VMs).
- Enhances performance for caching metrics.

---

### 2. MySQL Optimization
In the configuration file `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`, the following changes were made:  
1. **Uncommented and configured**:  
   ```ini
   log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
   binlog_expire_logs_seconds = 432000
   max_binlog_size   = 100M
   
Benefits:
- Reduces disk space used by binary logs while maintaining an adequate recovery window
- Efficient File Management: Smaller, more manageable log files improve read/write speed.
- binlog_expire_logs_seconds = 432000 (from 2592000, equivalent to 30 days, to 432000, equivalent to 5 days).

## Notes

- This script is intended for fresh Ubuntu 22.04 installations.

## How to Run the Script

1. Update the system
   ```bash
   sudo su
   apt update && apgrade -y

2. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eugeniogiusti/zabbix_datacenter_monitoring.git
   cd zabbix_datacenter_monitoring


3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_zabbix.sh


4. Run the script as root:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install_zabbix.sh


5. Access the Zabbix Frontend / Find the serverâ€™s IP address:
   ```bash
   http://yourlocalip/zabbix


6. Complete the initial configuration wizard:

Database Name: zabbix
- User: zabbix
- Password: Password2025!
- Password Customization Notice:
If you wish to change the default password (currently set as Password2025!) used in the script, please update it consistently in the following locations:

    Step 5: Creating Zabbix DB (around line 38)
    Update the MySQL command that creates the Zabbix user with the new password.

    Step 6: Schema importing (around line 45)
    Change the -pPassword2025! part in the MySQL command to match the new password.

    Step 8: Configuring Zabbix Server (around line 55)
    Modify the password in the Zabbix server configuration file (in the line setting DBPassword=) accordingly.

Failure to update all these sections with the new password may result in connection errors.


- Follow the steps to finish the setup.
Log in to the Zabbix dashboard with the default credentials:

   ```bash
   Username: Admin
   Password: zabbix
